# 2D-Sphere-Projection
A simple project that projects an image onto a sphere on 2D canvas and aims to explain how it does that.
I intend on updating this project in the future with a more detailed maths-oriented explanation, however the code already has plenty of explanation in the comments. Should be great for learning! :)
